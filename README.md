# Cartesian-coordinates-x-y-
 Define cartesian structure to work with points in two-dimensional plane. Define type for the structure. Properties of cartesian structure:  - x stores real valued x coordinate of the point.  - y stores real values y coordinate of the point.  Define following functions:  - cprint prints a cartesian on console in form 3x+4y.  - cscan prompts user to enter coordinates of cartesian point.  - csum computes sum of two cartesian and returns result.  - csub computes subtract of one cartesian from another.  Test your function in a program that receives two points in cartesian from user, computes sum and substraction, and prints results on console in cartesian form.
